I want an image of LDME 2 customized for my laptop asus dm069d-r558ur as i don't have driver installed in image avaiable at official website.
When i installed mint on my asus laptop due to lack of driver many input like touchpad stop or not working so if anyone can tell where can i get driver of laptop for LDME or make an iso for me.
Thank you
